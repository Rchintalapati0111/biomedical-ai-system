💡 Usage Examples
Command Line
pythonfrom biomedical_system import SimplifiedBiomedicalSystem
import asyncio

async def analyze_research():
    system = SimplifiedBiomedicalSystem()
    insight = await system.generate_insights(
        "Alzheimer's disease protein aggregation therapeutic targets"
    )
    
    print(f"Hypothesis: {insight.hypothesis}")
    print(f"Confidence: {insight.confidence_score:.2f}")
    print(f"Targets: {', '.join(insight.molecular_targets)}")
    print(f"Sources: {len(insight.evidence_sources)} papers")

asyncio.run(analyze_research())
Web Interface

Launch the dashboard: streamlit run web_interface.py
Navigate to http://localhost:8501
Enter research queries like:

"Cancer immunotherapy checkpoint inhibitors"
"Parkinson's disease dopamine receptors"
"COVID-19 antiviral drug targets"
